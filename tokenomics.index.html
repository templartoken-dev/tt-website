            <h2>Token Details</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Token name: Knights Templar Token (KT)</li>
                <li>Token contract address: To Be Announced</li>
                <li>Total Supply: 1,000,000,000,000</li>
                <li>Safe Burn on day of Pancake Swap launch: 220,000,000,000</li>
                <li>Post ICO Liquidity pairs</li>
                <li>Initial Marketing & Development Wallet: 22,000,000 Tokens</li>
                <li>Initial Knights Templar Charity wallet: 22,000,000 Tokens</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Transaction Fee Summary</h2>
            <p>Knights Templar Token was designed to reward holders and investors. Every transaction (buy, sell, or send) has a 10% fee:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2% goes to the liquidity pools, decreasing price volatility and adding to your staked Knights Templar Token income and banking services.</li>
                <li>2% is distributed amongst all holders as reflection income, including the burn wallet.</li>
                <li>2% is sent to the burn wallet directly, making Knights Templar scarcer with each transaction.</li>
                <li>2% goes to buyback tokens on sell orders, which then also get burnt and added to Liquidity pools (50/50).</li>
                <li>2% goes to the Developers Marketing & Charity Wallet (50/50).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Manual Burn</h2>
            <p>22% of the total supply will be sent to the dead wallet on the day of the launch on Pancake Swap. The dead address will be the biggest holder. The dead wallet will continue to accumulate more tokens through reflection and on each transaction, removing them from circulation. These mechanics will further increase the scarcity of the Knights Templar Token, making it the optimal hyper-deflationary, passive income-generating cryptocurrency.</p>

            <h2>RFI-Static Rewards</h2>
            <p>In addition to rewards, Knights Templar Token holders also generate passive income from reflection interest. 2% of every transaction is redistributed to all Knights Templar Token holders in reflection. This happens automatically at the time of the transaction/s and will be reflected in your token balance. The burn address is a holder of 22% of supply, so each reflection cycle also helps deflate the supply.</p>
